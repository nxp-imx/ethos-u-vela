## TFLite Summary Table

The table below contains TFLite operators that can be placed on the Ethos-U NPU.  
If the constraints are not met, then that operator will be scheduled on the CPU instead.  
For any other TFLite operator not listed, will be left untouched and scheduled on the CPU.  
Please check the supported operator list for your chosen runtime for further information.
